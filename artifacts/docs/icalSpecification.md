Specification for calendars we are going to use for now (Nov 3,2016), 
created as a reference point for frontend and backend developers


All dates,  gathered from a user via web form is to be converted into strings
to be passed later on to corresponding controllers/helper functions that convert strings
back into their corresponding formats.

WARNING:    We are implementing a limited set of iCal specifications here, constrained by time
