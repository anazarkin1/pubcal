# PubCal

## What we are going to build

We are going to build a responsive web app, where people can share their calendars with the public using both desktops and cellphones.
A group of people with the same agenda (e.g. students taking the same class, people going to the same social gatherings) may find themselves checking dates all the time or forgetting something important. Or they don't realize the time and location for an event have been changed.Or people want to know certain event's date and time. (eg. Users want to know when and where the Olympic events are. They can search for Olympic calendar on PubCal)


Our app will have the following features:

  * Users can publish their calendars by uploading files or creating them directly on our web app.
  * Users can search for calendars published by other people based on dates, calendar name, location.
  * Users can recommend fixes and updates if they believe the existing calendars can be improved.
  * Users can log in and update their personal information and look up other user's profiles.
  * Users can follow people they like.
  * Users can rate and comment on existing calendars, and information generated from these will be processed to improve the search and recommendation system.
  * Users can choose to import a particular calendar from PubCal to their own Google Calendar account.
  * When the PubCal calendar gets updated, calendars that were imported via URL are going to get new updates too.
  * Users can keep receiving updates from the publisher via browser-notifications or emails.
  * Users will be able to set their calendars public or private (to certain individuals).
  * Owners can give permission of the calendar so that other user can edit the calendar.

  * Tech: VB.NET
  * Bio: Ivan is in his senior year with double majors in Political Science and Cognitive Science.

    needs the room for another event. He has to email all the club members about the changes in location and time,
    but some members don't read emails regularly and still show up.

    holidays in her new country, last time she had to stay hungry for the whole day because it 
    was a special holiday in Spain and the shops were closed. Also, it's nice to see different festivals

## Why users should choose our product
In our modern society, people often forget or don’t know what events are happening simply 
because there are just so much going on around them.  Then people stared to utilize their 
electronic calendars to remind them that what their schedule is like and what they need to do next.  
However it is irritating and some times redundant to add events to their calendars.  Here is what 
PubCal comes in to use.  Our application allows organizations, communities, and various groups to 
add their own calendar to our Application so that users can download them without typing them by hands. 
Users can also create their own personal calendars to share them to their friends and families.  
PulCal also has the up-to-date features which is when the calendar owners edits the calendar, it 
also automatically update users who subscribe their calendars so that users don’t have to worry 
about what whether if the event is cancelled or the date of it is changed.  Moreover our application 
not only allows users to keep track of what is going on in life, but also allows them to explore 
different events going on in their communities.  PubCal connects communities and bring people closer 
more than ever before.

One of the many alternatives we were considering was making PulCal a mobile application.  Although 
many people have cellphones now days, not everyone has a smart phone to run our application.  Therefore 
we made a decision that PulCal is going to be web based rather than mobile based to make it more accessible 
to the general public.  Another possible alternative we considered was implementing our application on 
the Google calendar or the Apple calendar.  However it would be really hard to implement some of the 
features we have, and we cannot assure the privacy of the users would be protected from that.  Therefore 
we have decided to set up PulCal by creating our own website rather than on a third party platform.

We also decided was the calendar owner can give permission to certain people who can edit their calendars.  
This would convenience businesses that might have more than one person in the marketing team to edit the 
calendar at different places and at the same time.  Another option we have decided was instead typing the 
calendars that were on their devices, users could also import those calendars as files to our application 
to make sharing calendars easier.
