# PubCal

## What we are going to build

We are going to build a responsive web app, where people can share their calendars with the public using both desktops and cellphones.
A group of people with the same agenda (e.g. students taking the same class, people going to the same social gatherings) may find themselves checking dates all the time or forgetting
something important. Or they don't realize the time and location for an event have been changed.
Our app will have the following features:

  * Users can publish their calendars by uploading files or writing them up directly.
  * Users can search for calendars published by other people, and recommend fixes and updates if they believe the existing calendars can be improved.
  * Users can log in and update their personal information and look up other user's profiles.
  * Users can follow people they like.
  * Users can rate and comment on existing calendars, and information generated from these will be processed to improve the search and recommendation system.
  * Users can keep receiving updates from the publisher from instant notification.
  * Users will be able to set their calendars public or private (to certain individuals).
