# PubCal

## What we are going to build

We are going to build a responsive web app, where people can share their calendars with the public using both desktops and cellphones.
A group of people with the same agenda (e.g. students taking the same class, people going to the same social gatherings) may find themselves checking dates all the time or forgetting
something important. Or they don't realize the time and location for an event have been changed.Or people want to know certain event's date and time. (eg. Users want to know when and where the Olympic events are. They can search for Olympic calendar on PubCal)
Our app will have the following features:

  * Users can publish their calendars by uploading files or writing them up directly.
  * Users can search for calendars published by other people, and recommend fixes and updates if they believe the existing calendars can be improved.
  * Users can log in and update their personal information and look up other user's profiles.
  * Users can follow people they like.
  * Users can rate and comment on existing calendars, and information generated from these will be processed to improve the search and recommendation system.
  * Users can choose to import a particular calendar from PubCal to their own Google Calendar account.
  * When the PubCal calendar gets updated, same update will show up in their Google Calendar
  * Users can keep receiving updates from the publisher from instant notification.
  * Users will be able to set their calendars public or private (to certain individuals).
  * Owners can give permission of the calendar so that other user can edit the calendar.

## Why users should choose our product

In the modern society, it is easy for people to forget what they are going to do next.
Digital calendars came along but people have a feeling that they are not closely connected to events happening around them and
those all over the globe. People find they need to use plenty of apps and websites to navigate the direction.
We are going to offer a centralized solution to help people keeping track of everything they need to know.
When users sign up for a group trip, they can have their itineraries ready right away, shared privately by the travel agency.
Users don't have to worry about changes in plan any more because they receive real-time notifications from the event organizer.


Product decision: (internationalization would be key)
