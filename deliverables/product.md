# PubCal

## What we are going to build

We are going to build a responsive web app, where people can share their calendars with the public using both desktops and cellphones.
A group of people with the same agenda (e.g. students taking the same class, people going to the same social gatherings) may find themselves checking dates all the time or forgetting
something important. Or they don't realize the time and location for an event have been changed. 
Our app will have the following features:

  * Users can publish their calendars by uploading files or writing them up directly.
  * Users can search for calendars published by other people, and recommend fixes and updates if they believe the existing calendars can be improved. 
  * Users can log in and update their personal information and look up other user's profiles. 
  * Users can follow people they like. 
  * Users can rate and comment on existing calendars, and information generated from these will be processed to improve the search and recommendation system. 
  * Users can keep receiving updates from the publisher from instant notification. 
  * Users will be able to set their calendars public or private (to certain individuals).

## Who are our target users

### User 1: Alex
  * Age: 22
  * Occupation: Student at UCSD
  * Status: Single
  * Tech: A bunch 
  * Bio: Alex is in his senior year with double majors in Computer Science and Mathematics.
    He is also the president of the history and society club, and he organizes public events regularly.
    He sometimes finds out he's in a situation that he needs to delay the event since the university building management 
    needs the room for another event. He has to email all the club members about the changes in location and time,
    but some members don't read emails regularly and still show up.
  * Goals: He wants to inform club members of the latest time and location for events

### User 2: Cristina
  * Age: 35
  * Occupation: Factory worker
  * Status: Divorced
  * Tech: social network
  * Bio: Cristina live in the rural area, Pamplona Alta surrounding the capital Lima of Peru. 
    People build their houses on the hills. She is the leader of this community and she often needs to broadcast some news to people living there. 
    The living standard is low but almost everyone has a cheap cell phone. 
    Several times a year, some medical teams would come to town and people can receive medical consultation for free.
    It is hard for Cristina to talk to each one of them since she has daytime job and she has to take care of two babies.
  * Goals: She wants to let people immediately news that are not covered in the TV.


## Why users should choose our product

In the modern society, it is easy for people to forget what they are going to do next. 
Digital calendars came along but people have a feeling that they are not closely connected to events happening around them and 
those all over the globe. People find they need to use plenty of apps and websites to navigate the direction. 
We are going to offer a centralized solution to help people keeping track of everything they need to know.
When users sign up for a group trip, they can have their itineraries ready right away, shared privately by the travel agency.
Users don't have to worry about changes in plan any more because they receive real-time notifications from the event organizer.
