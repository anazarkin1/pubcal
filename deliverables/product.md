# PubCal

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are going to build a web app, where people can share their user defined calendars with the public.
The app will be responsive so both desktop and mobile users can easily access it. Users can publish their calendars
by uploading files or write them up directly on our app. Users can search for calendars published by other people,
and recommend fixes and updates if they believe the existing calendars can be improved. Users can log in and update their 
personal information and look up other user's profiles. Users will be able to message each other privately and follow people
they find worth following. Users can rate and comment on existing calendars, and information generated from these will be gathered
and used to improve the search and recommendation system. Once a user subscribes to a calendar, there is a choice whether or not to
keep receiving updates from the publisher in the form of instant notification. Users will be able to set their calendars public or private.

 * Be concrete - Are you planning to build a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?
 * Be clear about what the problem that your product solves (or the need that it answers).
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams and/or links


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Alex is a college student at MIT, with double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
He is also the president of the history and society club, and he organizes public events regularly.
He sometimes finds out he's in a situation that he needs to delay the event since the university building management 
needs the room for another event. He has to email all the club members about the changes in location and time,
but some members don't read emails regularly and still show up. Alex really wants a good way to notify all 
the members about any potential changes.

Cristina live in a rural area where people build their houses on the hills. She is the de facto leader of this community
and she often has a need to broadcast some news to people living there. The living standard is low but almost everyone has 
a cheap cell phone. Several times a year, some medical team would come to town and people can receive medical consultation for free.
It is hard for Cristina to talk to each one of them since she has daytime job and she has to take care of two babies. She wants to help
out but doesn't know how.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

In the modern society, it is easy for people to forget what they are going to do next. Then digital calendars came along.
People have been using the conventional digital calendars for a long time but they have a feeling that they are not connected with people
around them and people all over the globe. Our app offers a solution to this problem.

 * Short (3 min' read max)
 * Essentially, we want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Highlight significant prodcut decisions that you've made:
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your product/users.
