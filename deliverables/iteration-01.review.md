## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sun, OCT 23, 4PM
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

Decisions turned out well:

 * List a few (2-5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * Support your argument (that a decisions was successful) by referring/linking to process artifact(s).
 - Choosing Slack for team communication because it was easy to share resources with members. It also allowed us to create polls when we
   had to make decisions such as meeting time and location.
 - Choosing github project page because we were able to easily add different types of tasks. It was very useful because it gave us a clear view of        	whether a certain task is needed to be done, in progress, or completed.  
 - Choosing BALSAMIQ to draw mockups because it was very convenient to work on mockup designs.


Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.
 - The roles we have assigned to each member are too general/broad. (Also, roles assigned to each member in plan.md file is too general)
 - Although we agreed to meet three times a week to discuss our progress, we only met twice a week at most. (Please refer to our plan logs)
 - We planned to have an online group meeting at the end of each week but it never happened since we realized that it's much better to communicate with each other face to face.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * List the changes you are planning to make, if any, from most to least important.
 * For each change, explain why you are making it by referring to a decision that didn't work well.
 - Instead of having scheduled group meetings for the next few weeks, we agreed to decide on the time and location of the next meetings only. Since everybody has a different schedule, it was hard to stick with the scheduled meeting time. We agreed that it would be more efficient to decide on our next meeting each time we meet, instead of having a set of dates for future meetings.  
 - As mentioned in the previous section, we decided not to have any online group meetings because we think it's better to have a face-to-face meeting for a more efficient discussion. 
 - We will be assigning more specific roles and responsibilities to each member


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.
 - Created mockup pages for that represent different views of our website.
 - Decided to use AWS server for server and mongoDB for database. 
 - Completed basic AWS server setup.
 - Completed basic mongoDB setup.
 

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   - We were not able to complete UML diagrams. We did not have enough time to do UML diagrams (and to come up with technical detail needed for UML diagrams). 
   - We did not have any online meetings as we thought it might get way too difficult to have an organized discussion when we have five members trying to type their thoughts at the same time in a single chat room. 

Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * Task: (code) node + express + mongo set up with basic MVC architecture in an AWS server
 * The reason to add and complete this task is because we have already chosen the stack we will be
    working with for the next iteration, next basic environment set up would be change dramatically 
    even if we change our designs. It is therefore in our best interest to complete this part ahead
    of time in order to focus on more important task during the next iteration.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.
 - Must implement the following features:
   * Install and setup React
   * Log in/log out
   * Search for calendars
   * Create/Remove/Edit/Import calendars
   * Download/import/view calendars
