## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sun, OCT 23, 3PM
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

Decisions turned out well:

 * List a few (2-5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * Support your argument (that a decisions was successful) by referring/linking to process artifact(s).

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * List the changes you are planning to make, if any, from most to least important.
 * For each change, explain why you are making it by referring to a decision that didn't work well.


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * Task: (code) node + express + mongo set up with basic MVC architecture in an AWS server
 * The reason to add and complete this task is because we have already chosen the stack we will be
    working with for the next iteration, next basic environment set up would be change dramatically 
    even if we change our designs. It is therefore in our best interest to complete this part ahead
    of time in order to focus on more important task during the next iteration.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.
