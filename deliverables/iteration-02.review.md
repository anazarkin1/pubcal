## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tues, 15 Nov, 2016
 * Where: BA 3195

## Process - Reflection

* Decisions turned out well:
    * Choosing mongoDB and pug in our implementation.
        * As we expected, instead of learning new, unfamiliar technologies, it was better to utilize those that 
          all of us were already familiar with because it saved us a lot of time. 
        * On the other hand, though it was our first time using mongoDB, it was actually a good decision because 
          all of us did know how to use SQL from CSC343 and mongoDB was very similar to SQL except some syntax.
          Therefore, we were able to learn something new in a short period of time. In technical respect, we liked
          mongoDB because it is flexible in that we did not have to specify as much schema as we would have to in SQL.

    * Separating roles into frontend and backend.
        * All of our group members (except Alex) worked on final project for CSC309 in which we separated our roles based on pages.
          In that project, because each person worked on front and backend of pages, we later spent a lot of time trying to combine and 
          unify variable names and syntax. In contrast, we did not have such problem this time as backend developers always agreed upon 
          variable names and modular decision. It was also easier to set up smaller group meetings such as "chat room" for backend developers
          as it did not require all the group members to make decisions about backend stuff (and likewise for frontend developers and the
          decisions they made).


* Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:
   * We may have planned too many functionalities and pages to finish for this iteration as it was a very busy time of 
       the semester. Because we can continue to work on this until we demo, we should have waited on some of the functionalities
       and focused on functionalities that is core to our app (such as create/subscribe/unsubscribe/edit calendars)
   * We took the horizontal approach where each team member may focus on different features. This led to features that had backend support but no corresponding frontend display. The verical approach is better for this course project because the scope is small and focusing on the same feature would lead to better prototyping and more efficient debugging.
   
* We are planning to make the following changes to our process:
   * Based on demand, we might assign different roles for the next phase of the assignment. This is to have a fair system where 
      everyone can learn different materials by working on various tasks.
   * 


## Product - Review

* Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
    * front end layout for index, profile, search result, show calendars
    * create calendars
    * import calendars
    * making fake data in database
    * making the video

* Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
    * edit calendars
        * Although we did implement this, we have not gotten to the point where it works
          perfectly. We simply did not have enough time to finish this. 
    * subscribe/unsubscribed calendars 
        * It is partly working but we are still getting bugs when we incorporate it with session/cookie. We also
          did not have enough time to finish it by the deadline of this iteration.
    * (add comments about more frontend on profile and also functionality)


* Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being met/completed:
    * Implementation of session/cookie was not crucial for this deliverable but we still ended up implementing it.
    * We also have backend implementation ready for showing most popular calendars on index page. However, frontend
      layout for this functionality is not ready yet.
