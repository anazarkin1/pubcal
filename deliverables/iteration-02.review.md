## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Tues, 15 Nov, 2016
 * Where: BA 3195

## Process - Reflection

* Decisions turned out well:
    * Choosing mongoDB and pug in our implementation.
        * As we expected, instead of learning new, unfamiliar technologies, it was better to utilize those that
          all of us were already familiar with because it saved us a lot of time.
        * On the other hand, though it was our first time using mongoDB, it was actually a good decision because
          all of us did know how to use SQL from CSC343 and mongoDB was very similar to SQL except some syntax.
          Therefore, we were able to learn something new in a short period of time. In technical respect, we liked
          mongoDB because it is flexible in that we did not have to specify as much schema as we would have to in SQL.

    * Separating roles into frontend and backend.
        * All of our group members (except Alex) worked on final project for CSC309 in which we separated our roles based on pages.  In that project, because each person worked on front and backend of pages, we later spent a lot of time trying to combine and unify variable names and syntax. In contrast, we did not have such problem this time as backend developers always agreed upon variable names and modular decision. It was also easier to set up smaller group meetings such as "chat room" for backend developers as it did not require all the group members to make decisions about backend stuff (and likewise for frontend developers and the decisions they made).


* Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:
   * We may have planned too many functionalities and pages to finish for this iteration as it was a very busy time of
   the semester. Because we can continue to work on this until we demo, we should have waited on some of the functionalities
   and focused on functionalities that is core to our app (such as create/subscribe/unsubscribe/edit calendars)
   * We took the horizontal approach where each team member may focus on different features. This led to features that had backend support but no corresponding frontend display. The verical approach is better for this course project because the scope is small and focusing on the same feature would lead to better prototyping and more efficient debugging.
   * We did to use the issues feature on Github as much as we anticipated.

* We are planning to make the following changes to our process:
   * Based on demand, we might assign different roles for the next phase of the assignment. This is to have a fair system where everyone can learn different materials by working on various tasks.
   * We will take the vertical approach where most of the team members try to focus on one task (such as enballing users to communicate with each other). This way we can finish most of the features that's core to our app.
   * Use the Github issues more often, so that we would have a better idea of what needs to be done at the current moment and increase the efficient of assigning work to team members


## Product - Review

* Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
    * Frontend layout for index, profile, search result, show calendars
    * Create calendars functionalities
    * Import calendars functionalities
    * Inserting sample data in database 
    * Making the video that presents our application

* Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
    * Edit calendars
        * Although we did implement this, we have not gotten to the point where it works
          perfectly. We simply did not have enough time to finish this.
    * Subscribe/unsubscribed calendars
        * It is partly working but we are still getting bugs when we incorporate it with session/cookie. We also
          did not have enough time to finish it by the deadline of this iteration.


* Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being met/completed:
    * Implementation of session/cookie (for log in) was not crucial for this deliverable but we still ended up implementing it.
    * We also have backend implementation ready for showing most popular calendars on index page. However, frontend
      layout for this functionality is not ready yet.
