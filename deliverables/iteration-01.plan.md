#### Artifacts
  * We use Slack for team communications
  * For the to-do list, we label items into seven different categories and maintain them in both Github Porjects tab and Issues tab.
  * We prioritize items based on requirements of the deliverables and the scope of the item.
  If an item is due at the end of this iteration or if it is short, we would try to
  finish it first.
  * We assign items based on the aforementioned responsibilities, personal interests and strengths.
  We would also reallocate items if a team member has an emergency and can't finish the task on time.
