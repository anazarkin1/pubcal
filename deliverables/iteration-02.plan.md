## Iteration 02 - Planning

* Start date: Sun Oct 30
* End date: Sun Nov 16

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities
* Roles
    * We decided to have two different roles, frontend developers and backend developers. We realized that this would be more 
      efficient than having each person work on both frontend and backend of a page (or pages) because we might end up having 
      different variable names that refer to same objects, etc

        * Frontend developers: Barry, Navie
        * Backend developers: Eddie, Alex and Nathan

* Responsibilities   
    * We further divided up responsibilities within each role. For both roles, each responsibility was given based on the page 
      that each person wants to work on. Backend developers were also responsible for functionalities needed for each page that
      they were working on.

        * Frontend developers:
            * Barry: index page, search result page
            * Navie: create/import/edit/download calendar page, display subscribed calendar page 
        
        * Backend developers:
            * Eddie: 
                  index page, profile page, login/logout, session/cookie, setting up mongoDB schema and inserting sample data.
            * Alex:
                  create/import/edit calendar page, setting up AWS server, making connection between SLACK and github
            * Nathan: 
                  handling search/search result, subscribe(add) calendars,  refactoring codes, general modularization,       writing script for video, configuration of mongoDB to the AWS server

#### Artifacts
* We use Slack for team communications
* For the to-do list, we label items into seven different categories and maintain them in both Github Porjects tab and Issues tab.
* We prioritize items based on requirements of the deliverables and the scope of the item.
If an item is due at the end of this iteration or if it is short, we would try to
finish it first.
* We assign items based on the aforementioned responsibilities, personal interests and strengths.
We would also reallocate items if a team member has an emergency and can't finish the task on time.
