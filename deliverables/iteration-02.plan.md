## Iteration 02 - Planning

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities
    * Roles
        * We decided to have two different roles, frontend developers and backend developers. We realized that this would be more efficient than having each person work on both frontend and backend of a page (or pages) because we might end up having different variable names that refer to same objects, etc
            * Frontend developers: Barry, Navie
            * Backend developers: Eddie, Alex and Nathan

    * Responsibilities
        * Frontend developers:
            * Barry was responsible creating the home page, login interface, the search bar, and displaying results after a search.
            * Navie was in charge of the functionalities of creating a calendar as well as its features. display subscribed calendar page

        * Backend developers:
            * Eddie was responsible creating a profile page, the feature of logging in and out, as well as setting up    the mongoDB schema and inserting sample data.
            * Alex was responsible setting up the AWS server, the server side API for the functionalities of calendar page.  He also connected SLACK and github to make communication easier.
